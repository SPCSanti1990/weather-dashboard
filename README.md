## Description
A Weather dashboard that lets the user enter a city name that is saved to local storage for later retrieval. The open weather map api is then called using the city name entered and a key to display the current weather, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a five day forcast. Each city that is searched is added to a column on the left to recall anytime the user wants without needing to retype the name.
